       " 'The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves, and the nights had been full of feasts and song.',\n",
       " 'Those had been the most magical days of her life, but they seemed a memory from another age now.',\n",
       " 'Robert Baratheon was dead, and her father as well, beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor.',\n",
       " 'Now there were three kings in the land, and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men.',\n",
       " 'Small wonder that they had to hold Joff’s tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep.',\n",

       " 'Ser Arys was fond of gossip, but only when he was certain that no one was listening.',\n",
       " 'The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey.',\n",
       " 'It was a poor thing indeed, and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats.',\n",
       " 'Most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister; of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few, the handful that remained at court.',\n",
       " 'Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk.',\n",
       " 'Lady Tanda was bracketed by her daughters, placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse.',\n",
       " 'Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse’s lap.',\n",
       " 'The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen’s cousins, so the Lannisters might claim her lands.',\n",
       " 'The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair.',\n",

       " 'In the back of the royal box, Sandor Clegane stood at guard, his hands resting on his swordbelt.',\n",
       " 'The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin.',\n",
       " '“Lady Sansa,” the Hound announced curtly when he saw her.',\n",
       " 'His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood.',\n",
       " 'The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke.',\n",
       " 'Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa’s name, but plump little Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly.',\n",
       " '“Sansa, did you hear?',\n",
